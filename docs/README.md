# Military Victory Conditions

Military victory conditions should be quite similar, so all the factions have the same objectives to achieve it. The
only exception are horde factions, which have to raze and loot more, as they can not hold settlements.

## Normal factions

* Occupy, loot, raze or sack 150 settlements
* Own 100 regions
* Own 160 units

### Horde factions

* Raze or sack 200 settlements
* Own 160 units
